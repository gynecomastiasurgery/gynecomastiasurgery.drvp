&lt;p&gt;As you consider gynecomastia surgery in Jaipur, it&amp;rsquo;s natural to have questions. Here are answers to some commonly asked questions to help you make an informed decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-what-is-the-recovery-period-after-gynecomastia-surgery-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What is the recovery period after gynecomastia surgery?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After gynecomastia surgery, you can expect a recovery period of approximately 1 to 2 weeks. During this time, it&amp;rsquo;s important to avoid strenuous activities that could hinder the healing process.
