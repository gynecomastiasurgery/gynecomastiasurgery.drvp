Anesthesia is administered during the surgery to ensure you are comfortable, and we provide you with comprehensive post-operative care instructions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Recovery time can vary from person to person. In most cases, patients can expect to resume light activities within a week or two after surgery.
