&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1: What is the recovery time after gynecomastia surgery?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovery times can vary based on the extent of the procedure and individual healing rates. Generally, patients can expect to return to light activities within a week or two. Strenuous activities should be avoided for about four to six weeks to allow optimal healing.&lt;/p&gt;
