&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What causes gynecomastia?&lt;/strong&gt;
Gynecomastia can be caused by hormonal imbalances, genetics, obesity, or certain medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Is the surgery painful?&lt;/strong&gt;
The surgery is performed under anesthesia, so you won&amp;rsquo;t feel any pain during the procedure. Some discomfort during the recovery phase is normal and manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. How long is the recovery period?&lt;/strong&gt;
Recovery times vary, but most patients can return to light activities within a week and resume regular exercise within a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Will there be visible scars?&lt;/strong&gt;
Our advanced techniques aim to minimize scarring. Incisions are strategically placed and often fade over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Are the results permanent?&lt;/strong&gt;
Yes, the results of gyno surgery are generally permanent, provided a healthy lifestyle is maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

In this section, we address some of the most commonly asked questions to provide you with a clearer understanding of the process, outcomes, and considerations surrounding gyno removal surgery in Jaipur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-what-causes-gynecomastia&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What causes gynecomastia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gynecomastia is often caused by an imbalance between estrogen and testosterone levels in the body. This hormonal fluctuation can be triggered by factors such as genetics, obesity, certain medications, or underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-is-the-surgery-painful&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Is the surgery painful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surgery itself is performed under anesthesia, ensuring that you won&amp;rsquo;t feel any pain during the procedure. Post-operatively, some discomfort and swelling are normal, but pain is usually manageable with prescribed pain medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-how-long-is-the-recovery-period&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. How long is the recovery period?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovery times can vary based on individual factors, but most patients can expect to return to light activities within a week after surgery. Engaging in more strenuous activities or exercise may require a few weeks of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-will-there-be-visible-scars&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Will there be visible scars?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our surgical techniques are designed to minimize scarring. Incisions are strategically placed and often fade over time, resulting in scars that are discreet and less noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-are-the-results-permanent&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Are the results permanent?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the results of gyno surgery are generally permanent. Once excess breast tissue is removed and the chest is reshaped, the new contour is likely to remain stable, provided you maintain a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
